# Multi-Vendor-Delivery-Data-Dashboard-in-Power-BI

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing delivery data from multiple companies including Noon, Arkan, and others. The goal was to identify key performance trends and outliers, and to develop a clear dashboard for stakeholders.

## Overview

- Worked with datasets from multiple delivery companies.
- Detected and handled outliers in order amounts, delivery times, and other key metrics.
- Built a Power BI dashboard that showcases sales trends, delivery performance, and vendor comparisons.
- Summarized the entire process and insights in a PowerPoint presentation.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI** for interactive dashboard creation
- **Excel / Power Query** for data cleaning
- **Presentation (PPTX)** for summarizing insights

## Key Features

- Outlier detection and handling
- KPI Cards: Total Orders, Average Delivery Time, Top Vendor
- Visuals: Trend charts, bar charts by vendor, maps (if location data), comparison visuals
- Filters by vendor, date range, and delivery status

## Insights Example

> "Noon had significantly higher order volumes, but also the largest delivery time outliers before cleaning. After outlier handling, performance metrics improved across vendors."

## What I Learned

- Managing and cleaning inconsistent real-world delivery data
- Identifying hidden outliers that skewed performance metrics
- Communicating insights visually through dashboards and reports
